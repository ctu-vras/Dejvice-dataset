# Dataset Dejvice

Motivation for collecting the dataset was an idea to automate a labeling process. We captured Dejvice's roundabout area in different time. This allow us to create a HD map and split points into static and dynamic subset. Based on this division and localization in HD maps we can create the bounding boxes around the points and statistically decide about a class.

## Setup 

For collecting the data was used Oyster lidar and gps (todo name)
```
Oyster lidar
- 10 Hz
- 128 lines and 45Â° field of view vertically

GPS
- todo specs
```

## Calibration

TODO


## Description of the data

We captured 26563 frames, but only 18856 was available with accurate GPS. Dataset capture was divide into 9 sequnces. 
Visualization of sequences in Google map is available on [map link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1KdB8-CveT3HbCh3U-pd8nBCAsRsPD6VV&usp=sharing).
